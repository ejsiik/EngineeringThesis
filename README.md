## Project Description

The project is a mobile application written in Dart using the Flutter framework. The main goal of the project is to facilitate access to services offered by a physical store by leveraging mobile technology. The application focuses on introducing a coupon system, awarding bonuses for registration, enabling communication through a chat feature with the store, facilitating shopping, and monitoring user transaction history.

## Features

- **Coupon System**: Allows users to use promotional coupons during purchases.
